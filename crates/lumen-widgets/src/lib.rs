//! `lumen-widgets` — the element model, the headless app runtime, and (from
//! T0.10) the built-in widget library.
//!
//! The headless runtime ([`App`]/[`Headless`]) is the integration point that
//! ties lumen-core (tree/state/events/semantics), lumen-layout, lumen-render,
//! and lumen-text together (02 §8). It lives here, not in lumen-core, because it
//! depends on those higher crates; the `lumen` facade re-exports it as
//! `lumen::App`.
