# Plan: the retained pipeline (remediation Phase A)

*Sub-plan for `docs/plan-remediation-2026-07.md` Phase A — the engine
keystone. Design + build plan, 2026-07-09. Companion to
`plan-fine-grained-view.md` (F-series; this revives its descoped F2) and
`plan-rendering-performance.md` (the damage/paint seam below).*

Goal: changed-frame cost scales with **what changed**, not tree size — the
ADR-007 "O(changed)" commitment — and `.lss` layout properties become real.
Every step is gated by the F0 coherence oracle (`assert_view_coherent`:
incremental ≡ rebuild-fresh) and the R0 golden corpus (byte-identical
frames, or intentional re-approval).

## Verified baseline (2026-07-09 investigation)

- `pump` (app.rs:470-556): rebuild when `force_rebuild || visual_changed ||
  time_driven || (write_changed && !structural_current)`; on
  `force_rebuild || visual_changed` it calls `clear_view_caches()` first.
- **View closures cannot observe hover/focus/pressed.** `BuildCx`
  (element.rs) exposes no accessor; `Headless.hovered_id/focused_id/
  pressed` are applied *after* the closures run — node flags in
  `build_node` (app.rs:1726-1729), `.lss` state parts in `compute_styles`,
  focus ring/caret in paint. So the hover-path cache wipe protects nothing.
- `rebuild_inner` (app.rs:1337-1406) reconstructs per rebuild: fresh
  `Tree`, fresh taffy `LayoutTree` + full `compute`, `meta` map, then
  `compute_styles` (post-layout), semantics tree, dep-index.
- `relayout_subtree` exists (lumen-layout/src/tree.rs:80) with exactly one
  caller: a lumen-layout test.
- Memoized `cx.scope` hits deep-clone their cached `Element` (element.rs
  ~556); scope/signal keys are `format!`ed `String`s.

## A.1 ✅ done (2026-07-09) — Hover/focus/pressed stop wiping the scope caches (S)

**Change:** in `pump`, clear caches only for `force_rebuild`
(resize/scale/stylesheet/theme — inputs a closure *can* observe via
`cx`, conservatively kept); `visual_changed` still triggers a rebuild but
**reuses memoized scopes** (they cannot be stale — see baseline).

**Accept:** new run-count test — a `cx.scope`d subtree does not re-run
when pointer motion flips `hovered_id`, while the hovered node's
flag/semantics state does update; whole suite's `assert_view_coherent`
stays green; `scope_memo_one_of_many` unregressed.

**Non-goal:** skipping the rebuild itself (styling state parts + flags
still refresh through the F1-memoized rebuild). Skipping it entirely is
A.5's restyle-only path.

## A.2 ✅ core slice done (2026-07-09) — Styles before layout; `.lss` layout properties become real (L)

*Landed: resolution moved inline into `build_node` (pre-layout, per-node —
no ancestry needed for compound selectors; dynamic classes already merged),
with `display`/`flex-direction`/`width`/`height`/`gap`/`padding`/`margin`
merged into `LayoutStyle` (element < .lss). The old post-layout
`compute_styles` pass is deleted; `emit_pass`/`get_styles` consume the same
maps unchanged. Guarded by tests/lss_layout.rs (incl. the text-height rule
and the `:hovered` layout-rule relayout); goldens byte-identical (no in-repo
sheet used layout props). Remaining property coverage (per-side, flex-*,
justify/align, min/max, grid tracks, position/inset, overflow) folds into
Phase B.3/B.4 as planned.*

**Change:** split `compute_styles` into (a) *pre-layout* resolution of
each node's rule set from (role, id, classes, states, sheet) — merging
`.lss` layout declarations into the node's `LayoutStyle` **before**
`layout.compute` — and (b) the existing paint-time application. Parse
grid track lists + per-side box properties (the parser half of drift
D#11). Rule origin: element `LayoutStyle` field < `.lss` (documented;
matches cascade origin order once B.6 lands).

**Accept:** `.lss` `width/height/padding/gap/flex-*` visibly affect
layout (new layout-from-lss fixture suite); 04 §10 rows flip
parse-only→rendered; R0 corpus diff reviewed (layout changes only where
stylesheets used layout props — none in-repo do yet, so expect
byte-identical); styling-lss skill + 04 banner updated (doc-currency).

**Risk:** state-part-driven layout (`:hovered { width: … }`) makes hover
relayout-triggering — acceptable (it re-enters the normal rebuild path);
document as a perf note.

## A.3 — F2 revived: retain Tree/meta/semantics/dep-index across pumps (XL)

The heart. Retain last build's `Tree` + `meta` + semantics + dep-index;
on rebuild, re-run only dirty scopes (F1 already knows them) and **splice**
their subtrees, leaving untouched siblings' nodes, style resolutions,
semantics, and dep entries intact.

Steps (each oracle-gated, landable separately):
1. **A.3.1 ✅** Scope boundaries become tree anchors: record node-range per
   scope during `build_node` (scope id → contiguous node span + parent).
2. **A.3.2 ✅ (2026-07-10, as copy-forward)** Memo hits hand `build_node` an
   `Rc` stub (no deep clone; the cache stores `Rc<Element>`); when sound,
   the scope's span is **copied forward** from the previous build — meta,
   node/computed styles, and final layout styles *moved* across (zero
   clones), flags refreshed against current focus/hover/pressed, taffy
   nodes rebuilt from the retained layout styles, nested span records
   remapped. Soundness gates: a per-span context hash (ancestor selector
   chain + container size + overlay/hidden state) must match; spans with
   per-node side work (dyn bindings, custom/canvas content) are `impure`
   and always re-lower; visual-state rebuilds disable copy-forward
   entirely (`:hovered` parts must re-resolve). Fallback is an owned clone
   of the cached subtree lowered normally. Meters:
   `FrameStats::{nodes_rebuilt, nodes_copied}`. Guarded by
   tests/copy_forward.rs + the whole-suite coherence oracle.
3. **A.3.3 — superseded by copy-forward (amendment 2026-07-10).** The
   acceptance below (O(changed) re-lowering, counted) is met by A.3.2:
   memo-hit spans skip style resolution, text measurement, meta
   construction, and dyn evaluation. What splice-in-place would still buy
   is skipping the O(tree) *shallow* walk (node allocation + entry moves
   + semantics/dep-index rebuild) — a perf refinement, not a capability.
   Revisit with the R-phase benches if profiles show the shallow walk
   dominating; the trigger metric is `pump_one_of_10k` wall time.
4. **A.3.4 — folded into the same revisit** (interning is measurable
   only against those benches; no capability hangs on it).
5. **A.3.5 ✅ (2026-07-10)** `LUMEN_FULL_REBUILD=1` — the bisect hatch:
   disables copy-forward and the A.5 restyle-only path, forcing the
   naive rebuild everything-every-pump behavior (the oracle's semantics)
   in a live run.

**Accept:** one-of-N-rows signal write re-lowers O(row) nodes (counted:
new `FrameStats.nodes_rebuilt`); `build_node`+semantics+dep-index time on
the gallery drops ~an order of magnitude on small changes; whole suite +
80-round F3 fuzz + coherence oracle green; goldens byte-identical.

## A.4 — Incremental layout: superseded (amendment 2026-07-10)

Closed against the two standing decisions: the R4 finding (2026-06-24 —
`taffy::TaffyTree::compute_layout` is a serial whole-tree solve; partial
re-solve across disjoint subtrees of one tree is not possible) and the F2
decision (2026-07-03 — incremental layout **skipped**; full-tree layout
stays, O(changed) comes from build memoization + damage-driven paint).
A.4 as written re-opened that territory without new information. The
someday-path remains the separate-`TaffyTree` split (its own design task,
bench-gated), unchanged from R4.

## A.5 — Only-affected restyle + per-node style memo (M, after A.2)

- **A.5b ✅ (2026-07-10)** Rule resolution memoized by hash of (desc:
  id/classes/states/ty + ancestor-chain/container/overlay context) →
  `Rc<(Style, computed map)>`; sheet/theme swaps and force-rebuilds clear
  it (`set_stylesheet`/`set_theme` clear the memo but keep the scope
  caches — cached Elements are pre-styling). Hits/misses surface via
  `style_memo_stats()`; 24 identical buttons resolve one cascade
  (tests/copy_forward.rs).
- **A.5a ✅ (2026-07-10)** State flips (hover/focus/pressed) are a
  **restyle-only** path: `pump` diffs the visual snapshot, re-flags the
  old/new target nodes, re-resolves styles for their *subtrees*
  (descendant state combinators like `.card:hovered button` reach below
  the flipped node), rebuilds semantics, repaints the damage —
  `ui.lastChange` reports `restyle`, `FrameStats.nodes_rebuilt == 0`.
  Escalates to a full rebuild when a re-resolved style changes a
  layout/typography-affecting property (`:hovered { width: … }` — the
  A.2 risk note), verified by tests/copy_forward.rs. Pointer motion is
  now O(affected subtree), not O(tree).

**Accept:** hover storm over the gallery: `ui.lastChange` reports
restyle/patch (not rebuild) per move; style-resolution counter shows
memo hits ≫ misses; suite green.

## Order & wave fit

A.1 (now) → A.2 → A.3.1–A.3.5 → A.4 → A.5. C.1/C.2/T.1–T.4/R.4 run in
parallel (independent of the pipeline). After A.4, revisit
`plan-rendering-performance.md` R5 fragment splicing (retained DL per
scope span) — it becomes natural once spans exist.
